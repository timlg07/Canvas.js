# Canvas.js
Canvas Manager for JavaScript

The canvas-class provides:
- Updating all nodes when the browser gets repainted (normally ~60fps, the current framerate gets calculated every frame)
- Drawing all nodes if necessary (the nodes with lowest z-index get drawn first)
- Handling clicks on the canvas individually for each node
- Some other functions like printing wrapped text and vector-calculations

version 1.2 (compatible with all previous published versions)
